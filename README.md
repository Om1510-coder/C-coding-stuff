# C-coding-stuff
Here are some of my basic C programming projects.
The codes are sourced mainly from the book by Kernighan and Ritchie, GeeksforGeeks, programiz and a whole host of online resources.
List of resources:
1. The C language by Kernighan and Ritchie
2. GeeksforGeeks -> C programming examples
3. Programiz
4. https://www.programmingsimplified.com/
5. www.sanfoundry.com
6. stackoverflow
7. javatpoint

I am using eclipse, online gdb, vscode as my environments. Onlinegdb is good for practicing remotely, but nothing beats the visual style of VsCode.
